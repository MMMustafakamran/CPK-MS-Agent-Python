# Autorecorder

Automated screen-recording suite for CopilotKit framework integrations. It
produces one narrated-looking demo video per documentation page: read the doc,
switch to VS Code and show the code that implements it, switch to the browser and
drive the live feature.

Currently configured for **Microsoft Agent Framework (Python) + React**.

> **Porting this to another framework?** Read **[ADAPT.md](ADAPT.md)** first. It
> is written for the person or agent doing the port, and it is the contract the
> `doctor` command enforces.

## Run it

Both services must be up first — the recorder refuses to start otherwise, because
a video of a dead page is worse than no video.

```bash
cd backend  && uv run --prerelease=allow main.py     # :8000
cd frontend && npm run dev                           # :3000
```

Then:

```bash
cd autorecorder
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

npm run doctor            # is the configuration sane?
npm run record -- --list  # what will be recorded
npm run record -- --quickstart
npm run record            # all pages, in order
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--list`, `--help` | Print every registered route and exit |
| `--doctor` | Validate the configuration; exits 1 on error |
| `--doctor --online` | Also probe every doc/demo URL and the selectors |
| `--<page-id>` | Record one page — `--quickstart`, `--slots` |
| `--page=<id>` | Same thing, explicit form |
| `--filter=<query>` | Record every page whose id or name contains the query |
| `--force` | Record even if the pre-flight health check fails |

Videos land in `videos/` as `<videoPrefix>-<NN>-<name>.webm`, 1920×1080, ~25fps
(Playwright's capture rate; it is not configurable).

**`videos/` is gitignored on purpose.** Recordings are build output — reproducible
from this folder plus `npm run record` — and committing them is expensive: 17 clips
at ~5MB, rewritten on every re-record, took one repo's `.git` to 348MB before its
history had to be rewritten. Publish them as release assets or to a bucket. Keep
this policy when you copy the folder into another repo.

## Reading the summary

```
   ✅ [PASS]  (24.1s) Quickstart -> MSPY-react-01-Quickstart.webm
   ⚠️  [PASS*] (31.7s) Inspector -> MSPY-react-06-Inspector.webm
        · Doc page (…/inspector): Timeout 25000ms exceeded
   ❌ [FAIL]  (19.4s) AG-UI -> MSPY-react-17-AgUi.webm
        · Demo step failed: Agent never produced a response within 30s
```

- **PASS** — every step completed.
- **PASS\*** — recorded, but the external doc page misbehaved. The intro footage
  is degraded; the feature under test is not implicated.
- **FAIL** — the demo route 404'd, never rendered a chat surface, the agent never
  answered, or the IDE view could not be built. The process exits 1, so this is
  safe to gate CI on.

## Layout

The split between what you edit and what you don't is the point of this folder.

```

Every framework-specific value lives in `config/`. If something in `core/` needs
to change for a port, that is a bug in this folder — see ADAPT.md.

## What a recording actually does

1. **Doc page** — opens the real documentation URL, waits for hydration, then
   scrolls at reading pace and rests the cursor on a code block. Clicks VS Code
   on the simulated taskbar.
2. **IDE** — renders the project's own source, read from disk and highlighted
   with Shiki, with the page's line range selected. Multi-tab pages switch tabs.
   Served from the frontend's origin via an intercepted route, so the doc page is
   fully unloaded rather than painted over. Clicks Chrome on the taskbar.
3. **Demo** — opens the chrome-free demo route, types the prompt, waits for the
   reply to finish streaming, and pauses for reading.

Two details worth knowing, because both were bugs once:

- Overlays are injected as children of `<html>`, which React owns on any App
  Router page. `ensureOverlays` installs a MutationObserver that re-attaches them
  if a render pass deletes them, and step 1 waits for hydration before scrolling
  so a remount cannot snap the page back to the top.
- Native `window.alert` dialogs are browser chrome, so video capture never sees
  them (and Playwright auto-dismisses them). The Frontend Tools page needs its
  alert visible to prove the handler ran in the browser, so its action installs
  a DOM replica of Chrome's dialog via `core/overlays/alert-dialog.ts` and
  clicks OK with the virtual cursor. Opt-in — no other page is affected.

- The Readables take ends with a simulated Windows 11 Notepad window
  (`core/overlays/notepad.ts`), opened from the taskbar and typed into
  character-by-character at human rhythm, holding the issue report for that
  page. Also opt-in per action.

- Playwright starts recording when the page is created, so the first navigation
  is dead footage. The doc URL is warmed in a throwaway page first, which cuts
  it roughly in half; removing the rest would need an ffmpeg trim in post.

## Troubleshooting

**`Aborting before launching a browser`** — a service is down. The message names
which one and the command to start it. `--force` overrides.

**A page fails with "Agent never produced a response within 30s"** — either the
demo is genuinely broken, or `selectors.config.ts → assistantMessage` does not
match this app's messages. Run `npm run doctor --online` to tell the two apart.

**The IDE highlights the wrong lines** — the line range drifted. `npm run doctor`
names the file and where its markers actually are now.

**A recording passes but the video is wrong** — the doctor cannot see cursor
placement or highlight correctness. Watch it.
